# Sample Readme Structure

This is a sample file for a new Readme.md I would like to follow up. 

# Definitions

This section describes the definitions or purposes of the project as a whole.

# Setup the repository

It is mandatory that a setup guide is provided in order to help future readers to understand the developer's choices and restrictions.

# Setup env files and config files

An .env.example is never gonna be enough.

# Setup database and Database Seeders

This might help in any case whereas DATA COLLECTION IS PRESENT! With a nice test suit it just feels right.

# Build the application

This instructions may help when delivering the final app to the user.

# Routing 

This section describes a list of routes and purposes

|Route|Purpose|
|---|---|
|/users/auth?vendor=web|Describes Auth Route|

# Stacking 

This section may be optional, it should include what stack and instruments are necessary in order to make things work.
